## Using this library

### Component Files

The suggested method of using the components from this library is to keep a local copy inside your project's git repository. Changes can then be made on that local copy for the project, and pushed back to the main branch.

To get the contents of this library into a project git repository:

1. Add the remote link:

    ``` git remote add libraries https://github.com/imciner2/KiCad-Libraries.git ```

2. Get the current libraries:

    ``` git fetch libraries ```

3. Initially add the libraries to a project:

    ``` git read-tree --prefix=2-Hardware/libraries -u libraries/master ```

4. Commit the libraries into the repository:

    ``` git commit -m "Kicad libraries initial commit" ```


To read in any changes from remote into the project repository:

1. Fetch the changes

    ``` git fetch libraries ```

2. Merge the changes

    ``` git merge -s subtree --squash libraries/master ```

3. Commit the changes

    ``` git commit -m "Updated libraries directory" ```

### Templates

In order to use the templates contained in this folder, you must add an environment variable called KICAD_PTEMPLATES. This will create a page in the Kicad template selector for "Portable Templates".

To add this in Linux, simply add these two lines to the .bashrc file

```
# Add an environment variable to add the GitHub KiCad templates
export KICAD_PTEMPLATES='path/to/github/directory'
```
